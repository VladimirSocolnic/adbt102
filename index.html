      <h3>Hello my name is Vladimir</h3>
      <p> Hello, my name is Vladimir I really enjoy working with the computer 
including hardware and software, yet I never had an experience learning 
Java before Boot Camp at the City. It is my passion to become an expert 
at different programming languages to be able to guard and serve websites 
and servers, edit and produce games. Bootcamp showed me that coding is 
a complex and requires a lot of knowledge to be able to code fluently, 
however boot camp Explained everything excellently and made it easier to 
understand for any person with any level of knowledge about coding. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). 

        My project is about a 3D interactive solar system model,  the closing of 
        the project is demonstrating understanding of different elements such as if statements,  
        loops,  randomness,  inserting different except from the computer such as I would your 
        files and images,  interaction from the user  by hovering the mouse which will change 
        camera position, classes, etc. (see images below).  My project is about a solar system
        and all the elements (planets) are stored in an array which then get a random texture 
        of a planet which then will orbit around the SUN. I achieved that effect of orbiting 
        around an object in 3D by allocating 3 variables that are drawn 60 times a second and 
        constantly changes and repeats itself.

	Hello everyone in this video I'm going to show my game to you, to start you off I'm going
        to talk about the key features of the game. The game itself is very immersive as whenever 
        the player is progressing throughout the levels many objects are talking back to the main 
        character by telling a short story which really engages the player into investiga
	ting the game world2 furthermore, just like this owl at the beginning of the game holding a latter in its claws.  
	As you can see the game had already introduced the player into the lore that he is a samurai who is heading 
	to help ok, following on there would be some enemies to eliminate and some scroll to be obtain which will help
	progressing throughout game. And again, the game gave a little insight to the player about the current situation
	and what is the main goal is. Following on to the second level we can see that the enemies had grew in
	number as well as the number of scrolls to obtain.  The game itself features many different and interesting 
	yet mysterious characters not including our main character who is a red suited samurai.  Talking about 
	interesting characters there is a mysterious ghost whos power grows with the number of scrolls that our samurai 
	is continually collecting.  
	The game will take the character on to the adventurous trip.
